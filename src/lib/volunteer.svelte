    <h1>Volunteer Work</h1>
    <h3>
      Over the years I have volunteered with a number of people and
      organizations, including the Chelmsford Open Space Stewardship, such as raking leaves
      for disabled veterans, helping plant crops for a local garden, and doing 
      maintenance on wilderness trails. Additionally, I have been volunteering
      with Operation Delta Dog since its founding in 2012. Operation Delta Dog
      is a non-profit organization that works to rescue dogs from shelters
      and trains them to be service dogs for veterans with PTSD and TBI. I have helped with
      event planning, presentations, fostering dogs, and more.
