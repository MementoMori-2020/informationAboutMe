    <h1>Past Internships</h1>
    <h3>In the past, I have worked with Nuvera Fuel Cells and A Mighty Blaze
      as an intern. Nuvera is a leader in developing fuel cell technology,
      and I worked with them to develop new ideas and create CAD models
      using Solidworks. A Mighy Blaze is  a company founded in 2020 during 
      the COVID-19 pandemic in order to help authors, new and old, get 
      publicity for their work. I was responsible for creating and maintaining
      the YouTube channel that hosts the authors' daily interviews.
