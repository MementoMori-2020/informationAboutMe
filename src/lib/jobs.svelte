    <h1>Previous Jobs</h1>
    <h3>
      In the past, I have worked for the grocery store Market Basket and
      the gift store The Paper Store. At Market Basket, I worked as a bagger
      and a cart collector for a little over a year, before I unfortunately needed
      to leave due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At The Paper Store, I
      worked as a cashier, stocker, and customer service, as well as processing
      and shipping online orders.
