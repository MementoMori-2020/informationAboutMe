      <h1>Education</h1>
      <h3>I graduated from Innovation Academy Charter School with a high
        school diploma, achieving honor roll or high honor roll every
        semester. I attended the school from grade 5 to grade 12. I am
        currently working towards a BS in Biomedical Engineering at 
        Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). My plan for the future is 
        to get an MS in Biomedical Engineering with a focus in prosthetics 
        engineering and design.
